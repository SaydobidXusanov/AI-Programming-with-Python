# AI-Programming-with-Python
This repository includes my personal project solutions on Udacity's AI Programming with Python Nanodegree program.
The course contains the following two **final** projects:

* [Use a Pre-trained Image Classifier to Identify Dog Breeds](https://github.com/SaydobidXusanov/AI-Programming-with-Python/tree/main/Identify-Dog-Breeds-Classification)
* [Developing a Flower Type Classifer with PyTorch](https://github.com/SaydobidXusanov/AI-Programming-with-Python/tree/main/Flower-Type-Image-Classifier)

I successfully passed both projects and acquired the certificate of completion:
