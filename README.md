# AI-Programming-with-Python
This repository includes my personal project solutions on Udacity's AI Programming with Python Nanodegree program.
The course contains the following two **final** projects:

* Use a Pre-trained Image Classifier to Identify Dog Breeds
* Developing a Flower Type Classifer with PyTorch

I successfully passed both projects and acquired the certificate of completion:
